I think this is how I am supposed to do this.  I need to go to office hours to make sure.  :)

My name is Kyle Alan Walker and I prefer to be called Kyle.

My email address is walkerky@oregonstate.edu

I am en electrical and computer engineering major and I am a second-year student but after this term I will be in junior standing!

I have signed up for Piazza! I love the incentive to post on Piaza and get extra credit.  I hope that it is enough to motivate me because I would love to get an A in this class.

I think the two most interesting things about me are that I am an extremely talkative/outgoing person, and that I am from Kansas.  I love to talk and to discuss random things all the time but I also am very into 'nerdy' things like programming and hardware development. I chose to go with ECE over CS at oregon state because I thought I would have a larger variety of jobs to choose from with ECE because I still have to learn how to code but I also will have a background with electrical components.  I guess that doesn't really answer the question but I hope it helped you know me a little bit better.  I am looking forward to this class and understanding different Data Structures.
